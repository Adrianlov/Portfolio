# Portfolio website project
___


This is a website that I created as a first project for my course with Learning People 
in my road to become a Front End Developer.

Users can visit my website to contact and hire me for they're future projects.


# Wireframes
___


I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

[index.html (xl and sm)]()
index.html (md, lg and xl)
band.html (xl and sm)
band.html (md, lg and xl)
music.html (xl and sm)
music.html (md, lg and xl)
tickets.html (xl and sm)
tickets.html (md, lg and xl)
contact.html (xl and sm)
contact.html (md, lg and xl)


There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from other users who tested my website.



# Features
___


## Hamburger button - Clicking the hamburger button triggers a full screen overlay menu containing the navigation links to all pages on my website. The user can click the links to navigate to the relevant webpage.

## Social media links - Each link opens a new page with the relevant social media page for the band (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). These links make it easy for users to access the band's social media profiles from one place. The social media profiles load in a new tab, which allows users to then return to the site.


## Form with submit button - Allows users to hire me by completing the form and submitting their details.
